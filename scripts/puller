# Ideas for next:
# - puller creds delete [username]
# - puller reload      (undocumented)
# - Better user/pass display from puller creds list
# - Re-route the return calls' exit codes to the outter exit codes (ex: exit creds_list_command)
# - Try again with the strength settings stuff
# 
# Bigger idea:
# Have a ./resources/userHome.txt that just holds "/home/ubuntu".
# Then, link it in to the rest of the system so that, if a user
# is named "paul", then changing the userHome.txt file to read:
# "/home/paul" will make the system still work for them.  Steps to
# make this work, as I can think of right now:
# - Change the USER_HOME variable in this file to just cat the userHome file
# - Inject the USER_HOME into the resource files (timer|service) as they get copied over,
#   - Use some placeholder for replacement such as <USER_HOME>
# - Make sure to also cat the userHome file in the other script files, and refer to them there
# - The functions and calls below (rest of this file) don't currently use USER_HOME all over. Make them.

# We assume we have SUDO privileges due to the setup script
# making sure we do.

# Configurations

USER_HOME=/home/ubuntu
credsFile=$USER_HOME + /puller-bot/credentials.txt
